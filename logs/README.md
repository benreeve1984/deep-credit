# DeepCredit Logging System

This directory contains the detailed logs generated by the DeepCredit system during credit rating report generation. The logging system provides two levels of output:

1. **High-level progress information** displayed in the console
2. **Detailed logging information** saved to files in this directory

## Log Files

Log files follow this naming convention:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_MODE_COMPANYNAME.log
```

For example:
```
20240331_153045_iterative_Trafigura_Group_Pte_Ltd.log
```

## Log Content

Each log file contains detailed information about:

- All API calls made during the research process
- Knowledge gaps identified and their priorities
- Tools/agents selected to address each gap
- Results of research activities
- Decision-making processes
- Timing and performance metrics

## Console vs. File Output

- **Console output** shows high-level progress information for easy monitoring
- **Log files** contain comprehensive details for post-run analysis

## Reading the Logs

The log files use a standard timestamp and log level format:
```
2024-03-31 15:30:45,123 - DEBUG - Detailed information
2024-03-31 15:30:46,456 - HIGH_LEVEL - High-level progress information
```

Custom log levels include:
- `HIGH_LEVEL` - Important progress information (shown in console and log file)  
- `PROGRESS` - Process updates (log file only)
- `DETAIL` - Detailed information for analysis (log file only)
- `ERROR` - Error messages
- `WARNING` - Warning messages

## Analyzing the Results

These log files can help you understand:
- Which gaps were identified and their priority
- Which research tools were used to address each gap
- How the system adapted when information was difficult to find
- The complete research pathway from query to final report

Use these logs to diagnose issues, optimize the research process, or understand why certain decisions were made during the report generation.
